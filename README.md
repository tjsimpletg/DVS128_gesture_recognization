# DVS128_gesture_recognization

The dataset .npy files are so big so can't be updated here. You can download the original DVS-128 dataset and execute my notebook script to generate the .npy processed files. Or download it by this link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11NJhaK81uAF2r5JvjT3xkLOY7Utqzy0E?usp=sharing

The csnn-simulator is from team CRIStAL-FOX.
